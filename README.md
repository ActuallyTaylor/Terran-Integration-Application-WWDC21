# Terran-Integration-Application-WWDC21
My winning submission to the WWDC21 Swift Student Challenge. You can play around in a genetic sandbox. Altering and changing the genes of species and then watching them survive.

To use the project...
1. Download the repository as a zip
2. Extract the Terran Integration Application .zip
3. Open the included .playgroundbook in Swift Playgrounds for macOS or iPadOS
   - Runs much better on a mac, mostly because of the speed at which it can update the SwiftUI views.
   - If I was doing this again I would have used Core Graphics to render everything instead of SwiftUI. It would be much faster.
4. Run the proejct in Swift Playgrounds
