# Terran-Integration-Application-WWDC21
My winning submission to the WWDC21 Swift Student Challenge. You can play around in a genetic sandbox. Altering and changing the genes of species and then watching them survive.

** The following assumes you are on macOS**
To use the project...
1. Download the repository as a zip
2. Extract the Terran Integration Application .zip
3. Open the included .playgroundbook in Swift Playgrounds for macOS or iPadOS
   - Runs much better on a mac, mostly because of the speed at which it can update the SwiftUI views.
   - If I was doing this again I would have used Core Graphics to render everything instead of SwiftUI. It would be much faster.
4. Run the proejct in Swift Playgrounds

To view the source code...
1. Download the repository as a zip
2. Extract the Terran Integration Application .zip
3. Right click on the  Terran Integration Application.playgroundbook and selected "Show Package Contents"
4. Navigate to Contents -> Modules -> Core.playgroundmodule -> Sources
   - This folder includes all of the Core code and UI code.
